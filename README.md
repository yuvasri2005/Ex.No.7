# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# Aim:

To design and develop a prompt-driven AI application that acts as a personalized productivity assistant capable of managing daily tasks, schedules, and wellness tips using large language model (LLM) capabilities.

# App Name:

Ticko – Your Productivity Partner

# Objective:

To create an interactive AI-based productivity buddy that helps users manage their daily routines, stay organized, and maintain wellness through conversational prompts.

# Software/Tools Used:

->Loveable AI

# Description:

The developed application, Ticko, is an AI productivity buddy that interacts with users via chat prompts. Users can:

  1. Add, update, or delete tasks.

  2. View the day’s tasks and schedule.

  3. Receive priority-based reminders and wellness tips.

  4. Interact naturally using simple text prompts.

**The interface displays two main sections:**

  1. Chat with Ticko Panel: Users can type prompts such as:

    -> “List my tasks for today.”

    -> “Remind me to study at 4 PM.”

    -> “I feel tired.” (to get motivational or wellness tips)

2. Task and Schedule Panels:
    -> Display current tasks with color-coded priority tags (High, Medium).

    -> Show today’s schedule with time, category, and duration.

# Algorithm / Workflow:

1. Start

2. Initialize AI chat interface (Ticko).

3. User Input: Accept user prompt (task request or wellness query).

4. Process Prompt:

   -> Parse and interpret user intent using LLM.

   -> Retrieve or modify relevant data (tasks/schedules).

5. Display Output:

   -> Update task list dynamically.

   -> Provide responses or motivational feedback.

6. User Interaction:
   -> User can click checkboxes to mark tasks complete.

   -> Chat continues with new requests.

7. End

# Sample Prompts:

-> “Add task: Call mom at 6 PM (high priority).”

-> “List today’s tasks.”

-> “Give me a wellness tip.”

-> “Remind me to take a walk at 5 PM.”

# Result:

A functional prompt-based AI productivity assistant was developed successfully. The application can interpret natural language prompts, manage personal tasks, display schedules, and respond with productivity or wellness advice interactively.
